Hello Jack, I was looking through your Automated Wheel Truing Stand Parts 1-3 and I found it quite impressive with the hardware used. I am attempting to do a similar project myself, I have some parts, and I'm currently working on a design, but one thing stumped me when trying to obtain deflection values. From what you have shown in Part 3, with the DTI deflection values with a range of +-3 mm, to get these numbers how did you obtain your zero point? <!--more--> AUTHOR: Nick AUTHOR EMAIL: n.basso12545@gmail.com AUTHOR URL: SUBJECT: \[Project Space\] Contact IP: 99.253.1.172 Array ( \[1\_Name\] => Nick \[2\_Email\] => n.basso12545@gmail.com \[3\_Comment\] => Hello Jack, I was looking through your Automated Wheel Truing Stand Parts 1-3 and I found it quite impressive with the hardware used.
