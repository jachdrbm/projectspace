I'm Jack Chartres, a mechanical design engineer from the UK.

Welcome to my website!

This site will detail some of the engineering projects that I'm working on in my spare time (when I have the time!).Â I try to ensure that they include some level of engineering design, electronics and programming with a focus on **automation**.

Each blog post will provide progress updates on projects I'm working on in parallel which will include topics such as CAD, 3D printing, drones, Python and Arduino. Some may have quite ambitious goals but I'd like to see how far I can get and hope to learn a few things along the way!

Hope you enjoy the read.
